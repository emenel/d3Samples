we are pulling in the local file for the d3 library. it is inside the libs folder and is a javascript file type.
we are using the v4 of d3 - this is the latest developed version with all the best revisions. still, as with any versioning system (think of your iPhone and all the apps in various updated versions - sometimes we will have to do some double-checking on things that we used to be able to do in the previous version)
- that's all noted here: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md
the "min" part of the file name just means that the file has been reduced to its most compact version - this will load faster than a version with lots of white space, comments and spaces

// -----------PART 1: BRINGING IN THE DATA-----------

//this data is formatted in a tsv (tab separated values) so we use the d3.tsv function to bring it in
//if it were a csv file we would use d3.csv, etc
//this is all in the d3 reference
//reminder: this is a function, so anything we do in here is only seen by anything inside of here :)
d3.tsv("bigPic/Designs-Table 1 copy.tsv", function(myData){
	console.log(myData); //let's find out - what does this data look like when we bring it?
//go to view -> developer -> javascript console
//you will see a lot of "objects"
//if you click the carrot, you will see a list of objects
//this has each one of your data entries

//so if we just want to access the first entry in the data, what do we do?
	console.log(myData[0]); //how could we get inside of one entry?
//see that it shows up and on the right side of the log, you see from which line this item is coming?


//what if we want to access the year for this first piece of data?
	console.log(myData[0]["Award year"]);
//can you access a different kind of data about the first piece of data?


//what if we want to save just this piece of data?
	var oneYear = myData[0]["Award year"];
//will this be accessible to the other parts of the script? (no, so... it needs to be a global variable - existing outside of a function)
}) //end of function that brings in our dataset as "my data"



// -----------PART 2: SETTING UP THE CANVAS-----------
//we declare that we will have a special variable named svgCanvas - or whatever we want to call it, where we will attach the canvas
var svgCanvas;
//ok, now we actually select the part of the html document where we would like this canvas to be attached to
svgCanvas = d3.select("#vizContainer").append("svg") //specifically, we are appending an svg to the vizContainer - a unique div we made in the html
		.attr("width", 800) //we decide how wide the canvas is
		.attr("height", 600); //we decide how tall the canvas is
//a note on semicolons: in d3.js, a semi-colon indicates that  you are done creating this element



// -----------PART 3: DRAWING ON THE CANVAS-----------
